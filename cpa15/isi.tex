\begin{abstract}
Research on concurrent systems requires modeling, simulation and
evaluation in many settings. We describe a design for Interchangeable
Simulation and Implementation (ISI, pronounced \emph{easy}), an approach that enables the simultaneous
modeling, simulation and evaluation of highly concurrent process based systems.

We describe how ISI can been used to design and evaluate techniques used in
storage systems. Our key insight is that, while the simulation of systems could
be implemented as regular discrete event simulation, the benefits of designing
it as the highly concurrent process based system that it is --- with the full data
and control flow in mind --- enables seamless interchangeability between
discrete and real time simulation.
